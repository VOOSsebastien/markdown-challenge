#### You can always count on me when no one else is helping you

In my entire formation i got some technical and educational skills or knowledge that could be interesting to develop different programming subjects . 
 I can speak easily in public , even if there is a huge crowd it doesn't really impact my stress or  my way of presenting .

 An other important point is that i don't have any expectations about my place in a working group , i can take as leadership , mediation , oral presentation , i can make the doc presentatino part even if my creativity isn't my main skill . 

 i also manage working in english so i can translate or oraly present a project either in english or in french .

 ##### Someday when i was 6 , i went to Disneyland paris with my family and my sister push me in a lift , unfortunaly i lost myself due to her wickedness . 15 minutes later my parents find me back in restaurant eating at the breakfast buffet . 

##### My sister is the devil and i really like to eat .
